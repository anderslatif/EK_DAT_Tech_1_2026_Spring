# AI

## During Lectures

Don't use LLMs during the lectures. You will miss out on crucial information.

If you don't understand something then ask in class. We can get a valuable discussion out of it.

If you are falling behind then raise your hand and I will estimate if we will wait or if you should just watch along.


## Exercises (Homework)

You are encouraged to use LLMs outside of class as a tutor to help you understand the material. Also use codelab.

Both in class and outside you are welcome to discuss the exercises with your classmates. 

Use old-school search engines to help you with exercises outside of class. This will help you develop the correct terminology.

The point of the homework in Tech 1 is really not for you to uploading a solution, it is for you to learn from it. 

It is more valuable that you struggle with a problem yourself without ever solving it compared to having AI generate the solution.
