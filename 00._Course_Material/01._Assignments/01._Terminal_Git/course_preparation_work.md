# Course Preparation Work

Welcome to the course! Before we get started, there are a few things you need to do to prepare yourself.

---

## Prerequisites

## Windows Users

You have Git Bash installed from the previous semester on the laptop you bring to class. Make sure that you can open it.

---

## Master the `cd` Command

This will help you immensely in the rest of the course and get you comfortable with the terminal.

`cd` stands for "change directory." It is used to navigate between folders in your terminal.

You can use it in the following way:

1. This command will move you into the folder named "folder_name" located in your current directory.

```bash
cd folder_name
```

**Tip**: Use tab completion to make sure that the folder exists. Start typing the folder name and press the `Tab` key to auto-complete it.

2. To move back to the parent directory:

```bash
cd ..
```

`..` represents the parent directory of your current location.


### Your Assignment

1. Open your terminal (Git Bash on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux).

2. Try to navigate. Remember to use `TAB` for auto-completion after writing cd + space.

3. Navigate back and forth between different directories using `cd folder_name` and `cd ..`.

## Setup SSH Keys for GitHub

This will make our lives easier when we need to push code to GitHub.

This is not easy to do and we will do this together in class.

It is being linked to here in case you miss it.
