# Number Conversion Programs

Write programs that take args and can translate them. Refer to the lecture of how to pass args to Java prorgrams in the terminal.

1. Write a program that converts chars to ASCII codes. Feel free to look this up.

2. Write a program that converts binary to decimal.

3. Write a program that converts decimal to binary.

For exercise 2 and 3, you will take the argument as a string and should loop over each character. In exercise 2, you accumulate a value and in 3 you construct a string. 

These are thinking exercises. Code-wise they do not require advanced techniques above your level, but they require a lot of careful thinking.

**Note**: You are welcome to solve the assignments in any language that you want.
