# Why binary?

Why do we use binary in computers?

<details> 
  <summary>Hint</summary>
  It relates to the hardware.
</details>

# Computers are powered with electrical current

Either it is on (`1`) or off (`0`). 

Transistors (electronic switches, ON/OFF) and gates perform logical operations with binary numbers

# Binary always doubles in size

Try to sum all the numbers to the right of each bit representation. *What do you notice?*

<img src="./assets/binary_numbers.png" alt="Binary Numbers">

<details> 
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  The sum of the numbers to the right are always 1 less than the number itself. E.g., 8 - 1 = 4 + 2 + 1

# From Bits to Bytes

As shown in the table here:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte#Multiple-byte_units

There is a historical difference between decimal units and binary units.

We will follow the modern usage of units such as KB, MB, GB, TB etc. to be 2 to the power of. 

1 Byte = 8 bits

| Binary Units                          |
|---------------------------------------|
| Byte (B) = 1 Byte                     |
| Kilobyte (KiB) = 1,024 Bytes          |
| Megabyte (MiB) = 1,048,576 Bytes      |
| Gigabyte (GiB) = 1,073,741,824 Bytes  |
| Terabyte (TiB) = 1,099,511,627,776 Bytes |

| Kilobyte  | KB     | 2^10 bytes = 1024 bytes              | 1,024                     |
| Megabyte  | MB     | 2^11 KB = 1024 KB = 2²⁰ bytes        | 1,048,576                 |

# Let's convert from byte to larger units

**1 byte = 8 bits**

```bash
$ ls -l
```

The values are always shown in bytes. 

*Can you convert to Kilobyte (KB), Megabyte (MB), and Gigabyte (GB)?*

*Discuss in pairs*

<details> 
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  You convert by dividing by 1024 for each step up (e.g., bytes -> KB -> MB -> GB).

    <h1>Hexadecimal (hex)</h1>
</div>

# Hexadecimal (hex)

Base 16.

Often indicated with a `0x` prefix.

Since we only have digits `0`-`9`, we use `A`-`F` to represent the values 10-15.

Hex is more readable for humans because 1 hex digit = 4 bits (since 2⁴ = 16).

*How many hex digits is needed to represent `11011011`? What does it say?*

Help: Try to convert it to binary -> decimal -> hex.

<details> 
  <summary>Answer</summary>
   2 x 2^4 = 2 hex digits and `11011011` is represented as `DB` in hexadecimal.

# Hex Colors

|-----|-----|-----|-------|
| 255 | 255 | 255 | White | 
|  0  |  0  |  0  | Black | 

- **00** = 0 (minimum)
- **FF** = 255 (maximum)

*How do you write white and black as hex colors?* 

*Can you figure out the hex values for these colors?*

# Signed vs. Unsigned Integers

In MySQL (not SQL) the keyword `UNSIGNED` can define a number type that can't represent negative numbers. 

Many programming languages support declaring an integer as signed or unsigned. 

E.g., in C/C++ there are `int8_t` (signed) and `uint8_t` (unsigned) 8-bit integers.

| Type     | Bit Pattern           | Range       |
|----------|-----------------------|-------------|
| Signed   | [s][7][6][5][4][3][2][1] | -128 to 127 |
| Unsigned | [7][6][5][4][3][2][1][0] | 0 to 255    |

[s] = 0: positive number

[s] = 1: negative number
