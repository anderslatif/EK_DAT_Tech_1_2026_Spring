# Motivation

We have two tables: `games` and `studios`.

Based on what we learned last week:

1. We would need to make two separate `SELECT` to each table to get all the data out. 

2. And then we would have to combine the data in the application layer. 

Thanks to our newly created relation (with foreign key) we can use `JOIN` to combine it all into a single query.

**Learning Goal**: You should understand different joins conceptually, be able to write them by looking them up, be able to read the syntax and have the ability to use AI to generate JOIN queries. You should not be so indifferent to the syntax, however, that you cannot debug the statements.
