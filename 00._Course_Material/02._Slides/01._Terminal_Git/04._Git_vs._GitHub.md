**Note**: You are free to use another git provider. Discuss with me if you to hand in assignments in alternative ways.

# Motivation for setting up SSH Keys

* What are SSH Keys?

You generate a pair of keys: A public key and a private key. You add the public key to GitHub and keep the private key on your computer.

When you connect to GitHub, the keys are used to verify your identity without needing a password.

* Why setup SSH Keys with GitHub?

GitHub has [disabled password authentication](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-08-12-git-password-authentication-is-shutting-down/).

You could create a Personal Access Token (PAT) every time you create a new repository but setting up SSH keys only needs to be done once. 

**Remember**: If you have a home PC, you need to set up SSH keys on that machine as well.
