# Pushing, Step 1: Adding Files

```

* Add a specific file or folder:

```bash
$ git add <filename/folder>
```

# Pushing, Step 2: Commiting Files

Commit with a message:

```bash

# Pushing, Step 3:  Pushing to remote

Push the code to remote:

# Pulling

If you are working with others on the same repository, this is how you get the latest changes:

```bash
$ git pull
```

# Git the status

This command does not change anything and is not required but it might help you figure out where you are in the flow:

```bash
$ git status
```
